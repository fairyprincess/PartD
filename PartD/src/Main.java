//Kia ora, I'm not sure where to document connection to Github so I'm putting it
//in the comments of this small assignment. First, I created a repository in Github.
//Then, I cloned the repository under the "Git Repositories" function in Eclipse. 
//The repository didn't have a class or java file, so after creating a new java project
//in eclipse, I merged the projects by utilising the team function in Eclipse and created
//a new "main" class, where the code is now displayed. Finally, I wrote in the code and
//saved it, sending it to GitHub as staged changes. These are documented in the commit
//messages in the repository. Nga mihi.
